# Deep Learning Projects

A collection of deep learning projects implemented using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. This repository includes both theoretical experiments and practical applications in neural networks and image classification.

## Projects Included

1. **MSE & MAE from Scratch**  
   Implementation of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) without using any built-in libraries.

2. **Batch, Mini-batch, and Stochastic Gradient Descent**  
   Demonstrating different gradient descent methods for training neural networks.

3. **Gradient Descent Neural Network (NN)**  
   Training a neural network from scratch using gradient descent.

4. **Image Classification: ANN vs CNN**  
   Comparing the performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on image datasets.

5. **Flower Photos Classification**  
   A practical project classifying images of flowers using CNNs with TensorFlow/Keras.
